        <h2>Accceptance and Intolerance</h2>

        <p>
            Good Friend Tattoo has a policy of being accepting and encouraging towards the presence of people of every gender, sexuality, ethnicity, ability, religion, age and type. Our studio and its staff will do our utmost to ensure that every person entering our space feels comfortable, free, in possession of their own privacy and will to share or not share. Any reasonable request that they have in relation to this will be validated, respected and accommodated where possible. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Good Friend Tattoo commits to maintain an environment that will will never contribute to the erasure of any identity or expression and will actively provide a space and attitude that seeks to enthusiastically accommodate any person with any identity or needs, within reason. Our studio will treat every patron or visitor with respect, dignity and an approach that recognizes their identity, if they would like that identity to be recognized.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the booking process, the artist will volunteer a safe space for clients to share preferences of treatment that will best accommodate their needs. This can range from communicating accessibility requirements to disclosures of pain or trauma, the creation of a safe-word for the tattooing process or the need for a partition or extra privacy for their tattoo. However, any client can choose to abstain from providing information that does not immediately relate to the tattooing process. If they do not wish to have their identity projected in the studio and in communications with their artist, this will honoured.
        </p>

        <p>
            To implement these values, Good Friend Tattoo will always be actively engaging in a process of ethical and informed consent where the clients comfort and safety are routinely checked in on and addressed if necessary. Consent is a process and one that we are committed to engaging with in order to cultivate and maintain an environment where everyone can feel safe, considered and free to communicate their needs, knowing they will be heard, taken seriously and will not face judgment. Good Friend Tattoo is also committed to seeking out training and education to further our knowledge and understanding of how to operate a safe and inclusive environment that prioritizes consent, trauma informed practice and individual autonomy. If you have or know of training that would further benefit our studio, please feel free to share these resources via our email: goodfriendtattoostudio@gmail.com.

        <h2>Sexual Abuse and Harrassment</h2>
        <p>
            Sexual abuse and harassment

Good Friend Tattoo also has a no tolerance policy towards sexual violence or harassment, and attempts towards it.  

 

This can include: 

    Breaking physical, verbal and social boundaries in a sexual nature that is not consented to,  

    Deliberately making attempts to cause someone to be in an unneeded state of undress not consented to,

    Attempting to use the conditions of the tattooing process to influence or precipitate a sexual interaction or gaze.
        </p>

        <p>
            Further examples not necessarily related to the tattooing process include: 

    Engaging in any unnecessary or inappropriate physical contact with someone without their prior consent, 

    Any disrespectful or humiliating behaviour related to a person's sex or sexual orientation,

    Unwanted sexual advances or unwanted sexual demands, verbal, written or physical,

    Expressing any sexually transgressive comments or sexually based jokes, 

    Any suggestions or innuendos directed at another person that can reasonably be read as sexual in nature.

        </p>

        <p>
            These are, however, not the limitations of the definition of sexual harassment or sexual violence. Good Friend Tattoo will address any behaviour or reports from client or staff that can be reasonably defined as sexual harassment when and if it occurs.
